# PremierLeagueRuleChangesCalculations
Program for calculating the changed standings for the premier league if it was decided to change the rules so that scoreless draws (0-0) would result in 0 points to both teams.
While a scoredraw (1-1. 2-2. 3-3, etc.) would still result in 1 point to each team. 
This could also be used as a starting point for doing other things with PL data.
